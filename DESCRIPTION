Description: Generates the path for manual tours
  ['Cook' & 'Buja' (1997) <doi:10.2307/1390747>]. Tours are generally available in the
  'tourr' package ['Wickham' 'et' 'al.' (2011) <doi:10.18637/jss.v040.i02>]. 
  The grand tour is an algorithm that shows all possible projections given sufficient time. 
  Guided uses projection pursuit to steer the tour towards interesting projections. 
  The 'spinifex' package implements manual control, where the contribution of a selected variable 
  can be adjusted between -1 to 1, to examine the sensitivity of structure in the data
  to that variable. 
  The result is an animation where the variable is toured into and out of the projection 
  completely, which can be rendered using the 'gganimate' and 'plotly' packages.
